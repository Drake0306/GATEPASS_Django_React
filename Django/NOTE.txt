* Start-Process -FilePath "C:\path\to\your_batch_file.bat" -WindowStyle Hidden


Replace "C:\path\to\your_batch_file.bat" with the actual path to your batch file.

Save the above script in a .ps1 file, for example, run_hidden.ps1. Then, you can run this PowerShell script to execute your batch file silently in the background.

* Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
